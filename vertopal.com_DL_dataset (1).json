{"\ufeffUNIT \u2013 1\n\n<s>[INST] What is the importance of linear algebra in machine learning [/INST] Linear algebra provides the mathematical foundation for many machine learning algorithms. Concepts like vectors, matrices, and tensors are essential for representing data, performing transformations, and optimizing models</s><s>[INST] What is Learning Machine? [/INST] \nMachine learning -> algorithms -> extract information from raw data -> represent it in some type of model. We use this model to infer things about other data we have not yet modelled. The fundamental unit of a neural network is a node, which is loosely based on the biological neuron in the mammalian brain.The connections between neurons are also modeled on biological brains, as is the way these connections develop over time (with \u201ctraining\u201d).In the mid-1980s and early 1990s, many important architectural advancements were made in neural networks. However, the amount of time and data needed to get good results slowed adoption, and thus interest cooled. In the early 2000s computational power expanded exponentially and the industry saw a \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d of computational techniques that were not possible prior to this. Deep learning emerged from that decade\u2019s explosive computational growth as a serious contender in the field, winning many important machine learning competitions. The interest has not cooled as of 2017": null, " today, we see deep learning mentioned in every corner of machine learning.</s><s>[INST] How Does Machine Learn? [/INST] Machine learning uses algorithms for acquiring structural descriptions from data examples. Structural descriptions are another term for the models we build to contain the information extracted from the raw data, and we can use those structures or models to predict unknown data.Neural network weights\u2013 Parameter Vector (Weights on the connections) </s><s>[INST] What is Deep Learning? [/INST] \u201cDeep Learning can also be defined as neural networks with a large number of parameters and layers in one of four fundamental network architectures:Unsupervised pretrained networks, Convolutional Neural Networks,Recurrent Neural Networks, Recursive Neural Networks</s><s>[INST] What is Scalar ? [/INST] Scalar is a real number and an element of a field used to define a vector space.In computing, the term scalar is synonymous with the term variable and is a storage location paired with a symbolic name.This storage location holds an unknown quantity of information called a value.</s><s>[INST] What is Vector ? [/INST] We can create a data structure called a vector via a process called Vectorization.The number of elements in the vector is called the \u201corder\u201d (or \u201clength\u201d) of the vector.Vectors also can represent points in n-dimensional space.In the spatial sense, the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point represented by the vector gives us the \u201clength\u201d of the vector.</s> <s>[INST] What is Matrix ? [/INST] A Matrix is a two-dimensional array for which we have rows and columns.If our matrix is said to be an n \u00d7 m matrix, it has n rows and m columns.Example: a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix illustrating the dimensions of a matrix.Matrices are a core structure in linear algebra and machine learning.</s><s>[INST] What is Tensor? [/INST] Tensor is a multidimensional array at the most fundamental level. It is a more general mathematical structure than a vector.Vectors can be considered as a subclass of tensors.Tensors also have a rank. A scalar is of rank 0 and a vector is rank 1, a matrix is rank 2. Any entity of rank 3 and above is considered a tensor.</s><s>[INST] What is Hyperplane ? [/INST] \nA Hyperplane is a mathematical construct that divides an n-dimensional space into separate \u201cparts\u201d and therefore is useful in applications like classification. A plane is a two-dimensional doubly ruled surface spanned by two linearly independent vectors. The generalization of the plane to higher dimensions is called a hyperplane. Optimizing the parameters of the hyperplane is a core concept in linear modelling.</s><s>[INST] What is \nProbability ? [/INST] Probability of an event E is defined as a number always between 0 and 1. The value 0 - infers that the event E has no chance of occurring, and 1 - means that the event E is certain to occur. Many times probability expressed as a floating-point number, but we also can express it as a percentage between 0 and 100 percent. The canonical example of measuring probability is observing how many times a fair coin flipped comes up heads or tails (e.g., 0.5 for each side). The probability of the sample space is always 1 because the sample space represents all possible outcomes for a given trial.</s><s>[INST] What is Distributions ? [/INST] \nprobability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that arandom variablecan take within a given range.This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors.These factors include the distribution's mean (average),standard deviation,skewness. A common distribution is known as the normal distribution (also called Gaussian distribution, or the bell curve).</s><s>[INST] What is Sample of Data ? [/INST] A sample of data - subset of the population of data that hopefully represents the accurate distribution of the data without introducing sampling bias.</s>\n\n\n\n\n<s>[INST] What is Population ? [/INST] Population of data - all of the units we\u2019d like to study or model in our experiment.</s><s>[INST] Explain Cross Validation? [/INST] Cross validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data.It involves dividing the available data into multiple folds or subsets, using one of these folds as a validation set, and training the model on the remaining folds.This process is repeated multiple times, each time using a different fold as the validation set.Finally, the results from each validation step are averaged to produce a more robust estimate of the model\u2019s performance.</s><s>[INST] Explain about Likelihood ? [/INST] When we discuss the likeliness that an event will occur yet do not specifically reference its numeric probability, we\u2019re using the informal term, likelihood.Typically, when we use this term, we\u2019re talking about an event that has a reasonable probability of happening but still might not. There also might be factors not yet observed that will influence the event, as well. Informally, likelihood is also used as a synonym for probability.</s>": null}
